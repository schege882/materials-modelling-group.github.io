# **RESEARCH THEMES**
Material science is a dynamic field at the frontiers of innovation bridging fundamental
research and practical applications.

## **Electronic structure**
Electronic structure refers to how electrons are arranged within a material, influencing 
properties like conductivity and strength of a material. Electronic structure is studied 
using methods such as <abbr title="Density Functional Theory">DFT</abbr>.

## **Machine learning**
Machine learning, a subset of artificial intelligence, involves training algorithms on large
datasets to identify patterns and make predictions, reducing the need for extensive experimental
trials. In material science, it is applied to predict crystal structures, material properties and
discover new materials with specific characteristics.
Common algorithms include neural networks, support vector machines, and random forests.
These models are trained on datasets from sources like the Materials Project, enabling predictions with high accuracy in fields such as superconductivity, thermoelectrics and catalysis.

## **High throughput computing**
High throughput calculations involve automating computational processes to screen a large number of materials or parameter sets efficiently, often using methods like Density Functional Theory (DFT).
The methodology includes setting up and running multiple simulations in parallel, with specific parameters,
enabling the identification of promising candidate materials and in turn facilitating focused experimental efforts.

## **High perfomance computing**
HPC involves aggregating computing power to deliver performance far beyond typical desktop computers, essential for
simulations requiring significant processing power, such as quantum mechanical calculations, molecular dynamics,
and large-scale data analysis. It supports parallel processing and is characterized by high-speed processing power,
high-performance networks, and large-memory capacity. In material science, HPC is crucial in powering complex simulations
such as DFT calculations for electronic structure.
