The [Materials Modeling Group](https://materials-modelling-group.github.io) is hosting the third event of the year long APhRICA program, with an emphasis on methodological aspects of DFT.
In the school are a total of 17 participants, from 7 different countries, including Kenya, Rwanda, Peru and Syria with lecturers drawn from Kenya, France and Italy. 
The aim of this event is extensive methodological training, taking the participants beyond an introduction to the field of condensed matter, and giving them in depth lectures on advanced theoretical knowledge in Density Functional Theory.

A key outcome of this overall project would be, after the completion of this initiative, that it will no longer be necessary for such advanced training to be conducted by experts from outside the continent, but the knowledge will be resident in local experts.
In-depth subject matter expertise is still to a great extent undeveloped in the region, and this is a shortcoming that other parallel efforts have been unable to address. 
This event has received support from the CNR-ISM, the Abdus Salaam ICTP, the CNRS and facilitation from the Technical University of Kenya, Masinde Muliro University and Moi University.
